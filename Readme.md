# Garden Helper

## About

This is something I threw together to help me keep track of my plants. Currently it checks soil moisture and ambient temperature every 30 seconds and draws an update to a small screen for somewhat immediate feedback. In addition, it keeps an hourly log of the conditions in a CSV file and sends a notification through a Telegram bot if the soil moisture drops below an arbitrary limit. 

## Future plans

I am planning on adding additional functionality to this project such as possibly adding the ability to water plants when the moisture is low and reminders to check macro nutrient levels on a periodic schedule.
